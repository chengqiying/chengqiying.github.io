               	  <p>The client of this project is ING (International Netherland Group).Aligned with the needs of customers and the client (ING), this project designs a social media feedback system for ING. The goal is to give customers the impression that their feedback is valued and appreciated by the bank, meanwhile help the bank make efficient use of the feedback from customers. This projects works on a social media platform, and one of the most popular social media, Facebook, is a trial in the project.</p>

                	<p>Creat an easier way for customers to give feedback. Design a more efficient way for ING to collect feedback and also make customers interested and feel valued.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Email introduction: </span>In the concept of this stage, I chose email as the main way to introduce the new feedback system to customers. Brochure and advertisements are also included. In the second email, ING would mention the number of the customer’s friends who are using the system on Facebook as a more persuasive introduction.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Biomimicry desgin method: </span>In this section, I tried to visulize the process of feedback generating, being dealt with and decreasing by a kind of living creature. I went through two ways to design the dynamic process. In the first version, the simple colourful circles represent the feedback. The improved one is that the virus’s lifecycle represents the changing process of feedback.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Social media platform: </span>This projects works on a social media platform as it is becoming the popular and essential platform to express and communicate, therefore one of the most popular social media, Facebook is a trial in the project for this semester.</p>

            	<h2>Field Research</h2>
                <div id="context-text">
                	<p>Through the research on ING, it could be concluded that in the current feedback system of ING, there are four main ways for the customers to give their feedback to the bank: Facebook message, ING web, email and phone call. As for the dealing method of these feedback, ING usually gets a score about their service from customers through the email questionnaire. Then they calculate the average socore every week for evaluation their services and products.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">ING's Need: </span>"We need customers’ feedback to improve and deliver a better service for them, and we also want to be close to users and maintain the customer loyalty."<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Customer's Need: </span>"We need a more handy way to express our feelings of the services. We expect to know what would happen after we give our feedback to the bank."</p>

                	<p>It could be summed up from the user and client test. The holistic concept suited the needs of both customers and the bank. Concerning the advice from users and client,there were still some details could be improved, like the dynamic process after ING have improved the service, the interface for ING staff to check the inital infromation etc. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/558do9uw954aidd/Report_QiyingCheng_M11%20with%20analysis%20process.pdf?dl=0">See more feedback.</a></p>

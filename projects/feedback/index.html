               	  <p>The client of this project is ING (International Netherland Group).Aligned with the needs of customers and the client (ING), this project designs a social media feedback system for ING. The goal is to give customers the impression that their feedback is valued and appreciated by the bank, meanwhile help the bank make efficient use of the feedback from customers.

                	<p>Creat an easier way for customers to give feedback. Design a more efficient way for ING to collect feedback and also make customers interested and feel valued.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Email introduction: </span>In the concept of this stage, I chose email as the main way to introduce the new feedback system to customers. Brochure and advertisements are also included. In the second email, ING would mention the number of the customer’s friends who are using the system on Facebook as a more persuasive introduction.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Biomimicry desgin method: </span>In this section, I tried to visulize the process of feedback generating, being dealt with and decreasing by a kind of living creature. I went through two ways to design the dynamic process. In the first version, the simple colourful circles represent the feedback. The improved one is that the virus’s lifecycle represents the changing process of feedback.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Social media platform: </span>This projects works on a social media platform as it is becoming the popular and essential platform to express and communicate, therefore one of the most popular social media, Facebook is a trial in the project for this semester.</p>

situation that the sense of community in Hertoghof was at a quite low level. In the other hand, it indicated that improvements needed be made in this apartment. Although the physical environment limits the connection, digital service
still has opportunities to be applied and further help residents to build a stronger community.</p>

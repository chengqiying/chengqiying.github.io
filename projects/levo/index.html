                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Target group: </span>the number of older adults is increasing. Older adults want to live in their own home as long as possible. The growth of our current health care system does not suffice the needed care for this growing population. Therefore smart solutions in houses need to enable this autonomy and provide care instead.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">needs in kitchen: </span>people increasingly value the quality of food, cooking and dining.The kitchen changes from a closed space to a part of the house where you invite others for this important social activity.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Opportunity: </span>combining our design values, Vogel’s competencies, societal changes and trends within the target group, we believe that Vogel’s can expand the kitchen experience.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Vogel's: </span>vogel’s already has engineering expertise and knowledge to develop the product. Production can be outsourced to their existing partner and new product will be sold through retail partners.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">IKEA: </span>IKEA can introduce this new product line to an existing market. A deal will be made so IKEA has exclusive rights for the first years, so Vogel’s builds brand confidence in this new market.<br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Future plan: </span>in the future, Vogel’s can start collaborating with for example Bruynzeel and create “Vogel’s kitchens” integrated the mechanisms. At this stage, more revenue streams can be created.</p>

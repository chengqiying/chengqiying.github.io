                	<p>Levo is designed as the mechanical systems that improve the ergonomics of the kitchen, and enhance the accessibility of cooking utensils and appliances. These products can be build into existing kitchens, and later integrated into new kitchens. This project aims at supporting elderly people to live carefree, independently and autonomously, so that they are confident to function in everyday life. In our opinion, independence is fundamental for a meaningful and high quality of life.</p>

                        <p>Trend research shows that older adults want to live in their own home as long as possible. Besides, the growth of our current health care system does not suffice the needed care for this growing population. Therefore smart solutions in houses need to enable this autonomy and provide care instead.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In homes the kitchen is becoming more important. People increasingly value the quality of food, cooking and dining. Therefore the kitchen changes from a closed space to a part of the house where you invite others for this important social activity.</p>

                        <p>Society is rapidly changing. Due to increased welfare and health care the average life expectancy is rising. The number of older adults is increasing, this provides a new market in which innovation is necessary. Vogel’s can play a important and lucrative role in this market.</p>

                        <p>First of all, Vogel’s already has engineering expertise and knowledge within their company which is needed to develop the product.

                        <p>IKEA is a good example, they can introduce this new product line to an existing market. A deal will be made so IKEA has exclusive rights for the first years, so Vogel’s builds brand confidence in this new market.</p>

                        <p>In the future Vogel’s can start collaborating with for example Bruynzeel and create “Vogel’s kitchens”. These kitchens have the mechanisms integrated. At this stage, more revenue streams can be created through other retail stores.</p>

                        <p>Our target group searches for a new kitchen solution because the current one is becomming inaccessible due to physical restraints. They do not have much awareness of the different offers on the market.</p>

                            <h4>Retail Shopping</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>After browsing for solutions, many older adults will go to a retail shop either for face-to-face advice (as shown in the user insights) or to purchase the kitchen solution. It is very important for Vogel’s to train the retailers and introduce them to the high-margnin products that they can sell. This can be done in a similar way as with Mediamarket and TV mounting solutions.</p>
                   </div>

                            <h4>Vogel's Market</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>Vogel’s can market their product at the moment a customer starts browsing for a whole new kitchen or for a new solution for his current kitchen. By using a Kitchenfitter system online and in store (similar to the TV fitter) a customer can easily choose the perfect sollution, tailered to his kitchen,or he can order modular parts for a whole new kitchen.</p>

                        <p>First of all, Vogel’s already has engineering expertise and knowledge within their company which is needed to develop the product. Secondly, production of the product can be outsourced to their existing partner. Vogel’s new product will be sold through retail partners.</p>

                        <p>IKEA is a good example, they can introduce this new product line to an existing market. A deal will be made so IKEA has exclusive rights for the first years, so Vogel’s builds brand confidence in this new market.</p>

                        <p>In the future Vogel’s can start collaborating with for example Bruynzeel and create “Vogel’s kitchens”. These kitchens have the mechanisms integrated. At this stage, more revenue streams can be created through other retail stores.</p>

                        <p>Our target group searches for a new kitchen solution because the current one is becomming inaccessible due to physical restraints. They do not have much awareness of the different offers on the market.</p>

                        <p>Finally we believe that buyers of the LEVO system will become embassadors of the Vogel’s brand. When friends and familie visit the homes and kitchen of our customers, they should be impressed with the comfort and ease that the LEVO system brings to the owner.</p>

                            <h4>Retail Shopping</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>After browsing for solutions, many older adults will go to a retail shop either for face-to-face advice (as shown in the user insights) or to purchase the kitchen solution. It is very important for Vogel’s to train the retailers and introduce them to the high-margnin products that they can sell. This can be done in a similar way as with Mediamarket and TV mounting solutions.</p>

                            <h4>Vogel's Market</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>Vogel’s can market their product at the moment a customer starts browsing for a whole new kitchen or for a new solution for his current kitchen. By using a Kitchenfitter system online and in store (similar to the TV fitter) a customer can easily choose the perfect sollution, tailered to his kitchen,or he can order modular parts for a whole new kitchen.</p>

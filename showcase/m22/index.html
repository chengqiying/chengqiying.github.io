				<p><span style="font-weight:600">User experience design in digital context</span><br>In this new era of industrial design, I've seen the design focus is transferring from product itself to user’s experience. Especially for digital product, form, emotional interaction and function details, are three vital factors which could greatly influence the life span of the product from user experience perspective. Think big and also think small details which live inside users’ pockets.
				<br><br>My vision is designing for user experience in digital context. I am passionate to explore how digital designs could well meet users’ needs and create thoughtful experience in the mean time. I hope users could be moved by the pleasant experience while using a digital product.</p>

			<div class="text" id="identity-text">
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Beliefs in digital products to settle realistic problems</span><br>The new gained experience of designing digital interactive products triggers my interest. I have experienced the pleasure and convenience that digital products have brought to our life and I also see their potentials in the market. Thus, I would continue the journey of exploration of digital products as a UX designer.
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:600">Go for aesthetics and details</span><br>During the projects, I want all the works look beautiful, clean and simple. I care about details both in life and design. By observing details of people’s behaviours and questioning details of told stories, I have got the ability to empathise users by getting myself immersed into the specific context.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Develop my skills in interaction design of digital products</span><br>I don’t have the experience to design an application in well organized process before, so I expect to be capable of structuring a digital product design process through ideation, information architecture, wire frames, low-fidelity prototype and high fidelity prototype.</p><br><br>
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Practice and further develop the skill of user evaluation</span><br>The evaluation session in previous projects acted as the last step and the feedback has been seldom further leveraged to the next version of design. So, it is one of my goal to effectively conducting user evaluation sessions with different concepts, and combining massive test feedback and translate into one final design.</p><br><br>
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Develop prototyping skill of on-screen products</span><br>With some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, I plan to learn prototyping out the design concept by using web application development technologies, such as JavaScript and Jquery Mobile, in order to let the users know about the design by experiencing it themselves.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Objective</span><br>Based on all the feedback on the three directions in last semester, I decided to continute with the third direction which contains a social component. As mentioned both by Philips and my coach, the third direction appears to be the most interesting one and it has the potential to add possible value to the exsiting social network.</p><br><br>
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Outcome</span><br>After three iterations of design and two rounds of user evaluation, I have designed a mobile application for subjective sleep data monitoring. It has been integrated with a social platform. People could record, communicate and check their sleep data in this app. Through evaluating with users, I have the analysis of the usuability and experience of this application, and also users’ opinions about the social platform applied in sleep monitoring application.</p><br><br>

			<div class="title"><h1>What I have learned</h1></div>
			<div class="text" id="deveone-text">
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Various digital product prototyping methods</span><br>In the early stage, I learned to use Quartz Composer to quickly develop rough ideas into interactive and communicatable prototypes. It is really helpful for discussing the ideas and collecting feedback.  After having a complete concept, I explored an online rapid prototype tool -- Invision to have an overview of the whole interaction flow. For the final prototype, I learned the knowledge of web application prototyping such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in order to code out an interactive and usable prototype. After mastering all those prototyping methods, I could flexibly apply them in different iterations of design process according to the goals.<br><br><span style="font-weight:600">Developing usability and experience evaluation skill</span><br>This is the first time that I conducted usability and experience test in a standard process. After two rounds of the evaluation, I found usability test needs careful observation and recording, and experience requires an open attitude to user's opinions on the design. Through the evaluation session, I felt it is very essential to look at the design from a new user's perspective to gather fresh feedback as I have been quite familiar with it as a designer.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">A systematical process of application design</span><br>In this semester, the first focus is to develop the chosen design direction into a presentable prototype. As mentioned in goals, I have realized the importance of a systematical process for application design. Before starting, I spent some efforts in learning how a professional team proceeds the design process in companies like Facebook. For application design, the first task is to clarify the information structure, which is quite essential because the following steps will rely on that. Wireframe will be created based on information structure, followed by interaction design which specifies how user could interaction with the app in related scenarios, and interface design which decides the appearance. The last step is to implement the static concept into an interactive prototype. With this structured process, a rough idea could be better developed into a sound concept. Also, the final design would be more convincing and clear.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Yelp - mobile search redesign </span><br>This is a redesign task from Yelp during my job application. It is about to improve the mobile search flow of Yelp's app in five hours. The goal is to design an easy to use search section on Yelp's mobile application. I started this design exercise with a user scenario to empathize the experience of the current search flow in yelp. By analyzing the info structure of search section, I found three aspects which could be redesigned to improve the user experience. Through this design exercise, I have practiced my interaction design skill within a limited time. It is a good chance to challenge myself to design from a company perspective.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">IBM - car rent website redesign</span><br>When attending the interview in IBM, I also did a design task, which  is to redesign the Enterprise website so that it feels easier to use and that customers can successfully compare rental car options, and easily make their reservation. I saw it an opportunity to applied my design skills in a company environment.  Further, I realized the importance of efficiently communicating ideas with people from multi-disciplinary backgrounds, e.g., engineer, product manager and designers.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">InsoleX - data visulization redesign</span><br>I had a chance to help optimize the data visualization of smart insoles. The goal is to customize the data collected by the insoles on a specific application and help users easily understand it. For me, it is a new experience to play as a visual designer and  try to improve the user experience through improving visuals.  I have got more familiar with what visual designers do in a team. This would benefit the communication with different designers in my near career.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Past</span><br>Four years' education of industrial design in China have developed my skills in design thinking and  ideal and concept training together with the related fundamental skills of sketch, modeling by rhino, prototyping on arduino and graphic design. I have obtained substantial experience of designing for physical interaction and executing with related technologies, which can be seen in the projects on my portfolio website.</p><p><br>In last semester I have enlarged my resource pool of user study methods through the exploration of new methods, and applied them in my project process. The approach of seeking user needs has been broadened by trying desktop research, DSD cards(M21 module) and participatory design. In the process of ideation, I kept it open and tried my best to collect inspirations from users, engineers, designers, experts and clients, to stimulate creative and attractive ideas.</p><br>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Present</span><br>In the M22 semester, the main learning activity is the final master project. Compared with last semester, the development focus has been shifted from user study and idea exploration to systematical digital product design, digital prototyping and user evaluation(see project development). Except that, through a few job interviews, I have practiced my communication and interaction design skills. Also, I found out that the design process is pretty different between what I usually take in the university and what the teams intend to do in a company environment. They care more from the practical perspective, and as students, we prefer to explore various novel ideas. In summary, I have mainly developed my competency in user focus and perspective, design research process, forms and senses, and integrated technology in this semester.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:600">Future</span><br>I'd like to start my career as a UX designer for digital products design after graduation. In the next couple of years, I'll firstly learn to get used to the work system in the company. Meanwhile, I want to improve my communication skill from a strategic angle, as it is very important for a designer to sell and deliver the concept to both colleges and clients. I'll continue learning UX design to strengthen my expertise and also keeping up with the design trends.  In the long term, I expect to be more sharp in user experience by gaining experience in knowing what is the appropriate solution for a related context.</p>

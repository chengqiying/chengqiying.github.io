                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Bechalor: </span>The four years' education of industrial design in China have developed my skills in design thinking and  ideal and concept training together with the related fundamental skills of sketch, modeling by rhino, prototyping on arduino and graphic design. I have obtained substantial experience of designing for physical interaction and executing with related technologies, which can be seen in the projects on my portfolio website.</p><p><span style="color:#00BCD4">M1 in TU/e: </span>In the past two semesters here in TU/e, I set the vision of service design in the beginning and shifted to digital user experience centered service design in M12. The whole learning process was guided by the competency based education system which was a fresh new environment for me. I was grateful to this, because it not only gave me the choice to study service design and also provided the chance to systematically develop my competencies as a designer on an overall level. Through this year, I have become more comfortable with the system and gradually connected my culture background within the design and life. By doing the design project and research project, I have learned the big difference between them and I found I would like to be a designer instead if a researcher in future.</p>

                <p>In summary,  competency wise, I have developed my competency mainly in user focus and perspective, design research process, and idea and concepts. The rest competencies have also been partly developed together in project, modules and self-directed learning activities. As for the final master project, I have been keeping an holistic picture of the process in my mind and adjusting it due to realistic situations. It is a great chance to challenge myself to manage various aspectes in one project at the same time and have the confidence to continue it till nest semester.<br><br>I have enlarged my resource pool of user study through the exploration of new methods and applying them in my project. The approach of seeking user needs has been broadened by trying desktop research, DSD cards and participatory design. In the process of ideation, I kept it open and tried my best to collect inspirations from users, engineers, designers, experts and clients, to stimulate creative and attractive ideas. This is the first time I took this kind of way to help me generate concepts and it did work differently compared with how I proceeded in previous individual projects.</p>

                <p>Next semester would be the last semester of my master study . I will focus on continuing the final master project with no more modules. According to the project plan, I would have the second iteration based on the acquired feedback on the three concepts in this semester, and come to a final concept which will be evaluated with real users, experts and the client. After the graduation, I will start to hunt job opportunities  in innovative companies. My vision is designing for user experience in digital context, so it would be a new journey for me to apply what I have learned in school in companies and transfer from student designer to a more professional designer.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Practice and further develop the skill of user evaluation</span><br>In the next part of the project, I expect to mainly develop my ability to effectively conduct user evaluation sessions with different concepts, and how to combine massive test feedback and translate into one final design.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Be more daring in ideas and concepts</span><br>By reflecting on this whole semester, I am happy with the generated concepts in my project and the ideation part in modules. I still expect that I could be more daring to break some limitations and have adventurous ideas, because I noticed that it is a special right for a student to explore new design ideas which do not need to be practical for the current market, but should bring innovation to it.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Develop prototyping skill of on-screen products
</span><br>For on-screen products, I think it is more important to have a nice prototype so that the audience could get to know it by experience it themselves. In the following semester, I expect to further develop my skills in prototyping by web technologies,  such as JavaScript and motion design related technologies.</p>

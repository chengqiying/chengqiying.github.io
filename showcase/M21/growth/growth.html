                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Bechalor: </span>The four years' education of industrial design in China have developed my skills in design thinking and  ideal and concept training together with the related fundamental skills of sketch, modeling by rhino, prototyping on arduino and graphic design. I have obtained substantial experience of designing for physical interaction and executing with related technologies, which can be seen in the projects on my portfolio website.</p><p><span style="color:#00BCD4">M1 in TU/e: </span>In the past two semesters here in TU/e, I set the vision of service design in the beginning and shifted to digital user experience centered service design in M12. The whole learning process was guided by the competency based education system which was a fresh new environment for me. I was grateful to this, because it not only gave me the choice to study service design and also provided the chance to systematically develop my competencies as a designer on an overall level. Through this year, I have become more comfortable with the system and gradually connected my culture background within the design and life. By doing the design project and research project, I have learned the big difference between them and I found I would like to be a designer instead if a researcher in future.</p>

                <p>I have been curious about the holistic map of user experience methods. By online learning, I found the field of user experience has a wide range of methods available, ranging from tried-and-true methods such as lab-based usability studies to those that have been more recently developed, such as unmoderated online UX assessments. Although with all the methods on hands, it is not an easy work for me to apply them in the projects, but the key is to know what to do when. To better understand when to use which method, it is helpful to study a 3-dimensional framework in the below graphs(cited from Nielsen Norman Group): attitudinal vs behavioral, qualitative vs quantitative, and context of use.  It would play as a methods pool from which I could seek help when new methods are needed in future projects.</p>

                <p>I did a freelance job for the interaction design of an internal application of iGSK company. I mainly responsible for the interaction and experience design part according to the needs gave by the product manager. According with my vision of experience design in digital context, I took this job as a practice to work in a team and separately focus on the interaction and experience section, which was very much different with the individual and independent projects I did in TU/e. I would appreciate it for me to get familiar with the clear division of an ux designer in a company team. I also saw the importance of precise communication when I got the design needs and presented my design concepts.</p>

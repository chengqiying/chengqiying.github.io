                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Bechalor: </span>The four years' education of industrial design in China have developed my skills in design thinking and  ideal and concept training together with the related fundamental skills of sketch, modeling by rhino, prototyping on arduino and graphic design. I have obtained substantial experience of designing for physical interaction and executing with related technologies, which can be seen in the projects on my portfolio website.</p><p><span style="color:#00BCD4">M1 in TU/e: </span>In the past two semesters here in TU/e, I set the vision of service design in the beginning and shifted to digital user experience centered service design in M12. The whole learning process was guided by the competency based education system which was a fresh new environment for me. I was grateful to this, because it not only gave me the choice to study service design and also provided the chance to systematically develop my competencies as a designer on an overall level. Through this year, I have become more comfortable with the system and gradually connected my culture background within the design and life. By doing the design project and research project, I have learned the big difference between them and I found I would like to be a designer instead if a researcher in future.</p>

                <p>In summary,  competency wise, I have developed my competency mainly in user focus and perspective, design research process, and idea and concepts. The rest competencies have also been partly developed together in project, modules and self-directed learning activities. As for the final master project, I have been keeping an holistic picture of the process in my mind and adjusting it due to realistic situations. It is a great chance to challenge myself to manage various aspectes in one project at the same time and have the confidence to continue it till nest semester.<br><br>I have enlarged my resource pool of user study through the exploration of new methods and applying them in my project. The approach of seeking user needs has been broadened by trying desktop research, DSD cards and participatory design. In the process of ideation, I kept it open and tried my best to collect inspirations from users, engineers, designers, experts and clients, to stimulate creative and attractive ideas. This is the first time I took this kind of way to help me generate concepts and it did work differently compared with how I proceeded in previous individual projects.</p>

                <p>I did a freelance job for the interaction design of an internal application of iGSK company. I mainly responsible for the interaction and experience design part according to the needs gave by the product manager. According with my vision of experience design in digital context, I took this job as a practice to work in a team and separately focus on the interaction and experience section, which was very much different with the individual and independent projects I did in TU/e. I would appreciate it for me to get familiar with the clear division of an ux designer in a company team. I also saw the importance of precise communication when I got the design needs and presented my design concepts.</p>

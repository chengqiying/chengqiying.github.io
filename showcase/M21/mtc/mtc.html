        		<h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>It is a one-week module to explore traces of time, use and interaction in materials and reflected on our emotional responses towards various materials. Our team designed a set of rings which helped to explore the symbolic notion of 'Preventable and Unpreventable Ageing'. This notion was translated into combination of two materials. The first material ages through time (organic material) and second material ages through the interaction with it (durable/ long-lasting material).<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>In this module, I would like to develop an awareness of materials, how it unconsciously influence our perception about objects and experience. And then see how it could be used as inspirations in design process. Also I expect to understand user experience from the perspective of materiality and try to apply the new insights into user experience design.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Haptic sense could enhance user experience</span><br>I have seen a big difference between optical visuality and haptic sense on the exhibition, which is mentioned by Laura U.Marks. People got pretty surprised when they touch and feel the objects as it was not as same as what they thought when they use their eyes to perceive the objects. Moreover, it is an obvious phenomenon that people have the unconscious tend to feel the objects by touching. This helped me realised that in user experience design, it is vital to create a chance for users to experience the design through multi senses because it could help them to have a full experience about it. It is same case of Apple’s design.  Also in digital design, the optical visuality gives people the vision of the design and haptic visuality has a connection between vision and the design.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">From abstract notion to concrete object</span><br>The exploration of how we could narrow down the abstract notion of contrast between natural ageing objects and non ageing man-made materials to a redesigned object, is a process for me to rethink about the relation between these two opposite aspects. I came to realise the transition and integration between the total opposite characteristics(long lasting and natural ageing), which seems has litte possibility to me to combine them before. For me, the practice of narrowing down to an object design is an interpretation of the abstract notion in a concrete level. In this way, it brings me back to an object again.</p>

                	<p>I would try to apply participatory design method in my project when studying users and exploring the possible and appropriate ways of interaction between users and the design. It could help me to break the limitation of comprehension of users and gain more useful feedback about the design. I would also consider using the practices and moods theory to analyse users’ behaviour models and look for design opportunities.</p>

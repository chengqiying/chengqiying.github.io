        		<h3>dutch design week</h3>
                <p>The most impressive exhibition in Dutch design week for me was at Design Academy of Eindhoven. The graduation exhibition has provoked my’s vision by the students' powerful and unconstrained imaginary. They are driven by self-expression. I could see seek a lot of inspirations which are usually hard for me to get in projects because I have been focusing on designing for people. For instance, a student designed a set of mouth masks that could show various smile facial expressions when people wear the masks. I realized that they put more efforts to discover the essence of life and people, and then convey it by different forms of design.</p>

        		<h3>UX methods learning</h3>
                <p>I have been curious about the holistic map of user experience methods. By online learning, I found the field of user experience has a wide range of methods available, ranging from tried-and-true methods such as lab-based usability studies to those that have been more recently developed, such as unmoderated online UX assessments. Although with all the methods on hands, it is not an easy work for me to apply them in the projects, but the key is to know what to do when. To better understand when to use which method, it is helpful to study a 3-dimensional framework in the below graphs(cited from Nielsen Norman Group): attitudinal vs behavioral, qualitative vs quantitative, and context of use.  It would play as a methods pool from which I could seek help when new methods are needed in future projects.</p>

                <p>I did a freelance job for the interaction design of an internal application of iGSK company. I mainly responsible for the interaction and experience design part according to the needs gave by the product manager. According with my vision of experience design in digital context, I took this job as a practice to work in a team and separately focus on the interaction and experience section, which was very much different with the individual and independent projects I did in TU/e. I would appreciate it for me to get familiar with the clear division of an ux designer in a company team. I also saw the importance of precise communication when I got the design needs and presented my design concepts.</p>

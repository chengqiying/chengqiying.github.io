            			<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">User experience design in digital context</span><br>In my vision, design focus is transferring from product itself to user’s experience this new era of industrial design. A design concept is not only an elegant form and a fantastic function any more, but a realistic solution which can well address people’s needs and concerns in a specific context. Especially for digital product, whether it is user friendly will greatly influence the life span of the product. After the first year’s experiencing of service related project, I have been aware that service design is pretty user experience centered. But it is too broad so I decided to focus on the user experience part and develop to be more capable of that.<br><br>A hot trend of digital service is growing with the increasing use of smart devices, like tablets and smart watches. Designs on these devices have ushered a blooming time and showed great potentials in the market. I am interested in designing for user experience in this digital context and want to explore how the digital designs could meet users’ needs well</p>

                		<h2>IDENTITY</h2>
            			<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Beliefs in digital products to settle realistic problems</span><br>I would see myself as both a designer and a consultant of people’ life, whose mission is to provide innovative and helpful advice, in order to settle the complaints and dissatisfactions about currently organized services. The new gained experience of designing digital interactive products triggers my interest. I have experienced the pleasure and convenience that digital products have brought in our life and I also see their potentials in the market. Thus, I would continue the journey of exploration of on screen products and forward to an UX designer in my near future career.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Go for aesthetics and details</span><br>During the projects, I want all the works look beautiful, clean and simple, especially when presenting to the audience. Because I think the first impression is pretty important when introducing works to others and it shows the professionalism as a designer. I care about details both in life and design. By observing details of people’s behaviours and questioning details of told stories, I have got the ability to empathise users by getting myself immersed into the specific context.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Diversify the approach of empathizing users</span><br>I have been expecting to explore different ways of empathizing users. In the previous experience, what I have learned about how to study users are mainly conducting user interviews and observations. I wonder if there are alternative means for designer to understand users in various levels based on the design requirements. By acquiring multiple ways of user study, I could become more capable and confident in dynamic design contexts.</p>

            		<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Manage a design project within collaboration</span><br>Conducting an individual project is the most familiar for me design style in the first year. In the final master project, I feel it is of great necessity to involve a serious client and apply what I have learned. Close collaboration with client could help me to make a better combination between users’ needs and stakeholders’ requirements. I need this kind of development to get myself prepared for the job market after the graduation.</p>

            		<p>In summary, competency wise, I have developed my competency mainly in user focus and perspective, design research process, and idea and concepts. The rest competencies have also been partly developed together in project, modules and self-directed learning activities. As for the final master project, I have been keeping an holistic picture of the process in my mind and adjusting it due to realistic situations. It is a great chance to challenge myself to manage various aspectes in one project at the same time and have the confidence to continue it till nest semester.<br><br><br><a href="growth/growth.html">Learn more <span class="iconfont arrow">&#x344a;</span></a></p>

                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>This one-week module is facilitated by Philip Design. During this learning activity, we will explored how we could create innovative values for Philips existing brand(Avent) by sensing the business context and user context jointly. The design focus is on Mother and Child Care.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>In this module, I would like to develop an awareness of materials, how it unconsciously influence our perception about objects and experience. And then see how it could be used as inspirations in design process. Also I expect to understand user experience from the perspective of materiality and try to apply the new insights into user experience design.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Top-down design strategy</span><br>It is a new experience for me to start a design from the systematical and Philips business perspective. A top down design strategy was took to think from a holistic picture to specific concepts, which is different with the usual bottom-up way in design process. It helped to touch all the related elements and stakeholders of a product from a strategic level. Besides, the broad direction gave me enough space to divert my ideas in one hand, on the other hand it was a challenge to take all the information into account and narrow down into one concept in a short time.</p>

                <div id="part-2">
                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">From abstract notion to concrete object</span><br>The exploration of how we could narrow down the abstract notion of contrast between natural ageing objects and non ageing man-made materials to a redesigned object, is a process for me to rethink about the relation between these two opposite aspects. I came to realise the transition and integration between the total opposite characteristics(long lasting and natural ageing), which seems has litte possibility to me to combine them before. For me, the practice of narrowing down to an object design is an interpretation of the abstract notion in a concrete level. In this way, it brings me back to an object again.</p>

            	<div id="deve">
                	<p>I would try to apply participatory design method in my project when studying users and exploring the possible and appropriate ways of interaction between users and the design. It could help me to break the limitation of comprehension of users and gain more useful feedback about the design. I would also consider using the practices and moods theory to analyse users’ behaviour models and look for design opportunities.</p>

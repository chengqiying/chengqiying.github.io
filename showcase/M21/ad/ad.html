        		<h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>This one-week module is facilitated by Philip Design. During this learning activity, we will explored how we could create innovative values for Philips existing brand(Avent) by sensing the business context and user context jointly. We were required to redesign the ecosystem of mother and child care.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>I chose this module because I saw it as a chance to develop my awareness and ability of business thinking in a design process. Through cooperating with Philips Design, I expected to learn about the ways how designers work in an international company environment, and the different concerns of a design from a company perspective in a specific design case.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Top-down design strategy</span><br>It is a new experience for me to start a design from the systematical and Philips business perspective. A top down design strategy was took to think from a holistic picture to specific concepts, which is different with the usual bottom-up way in design process. It helped me to touch all the related elements and stakeholders of a product from a strategic level. Besides, the broad direction gave me enough space to divert my ideas in one hand, and on the other hand it was a challenge to take all the information into account and narrow down into one concept in a short time.<br><br>The detailed way Philips collects information and  finds user needs is sparkling for me. They interpreted the acquired information in a vivid scenario to help design opportunity seeking. This kind of way would be very effective and useful.

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Six perspectives and five drivers of an ecosystem</span><br>We were introduced with the concept of an ecosystem in the beginning. In the process of designing an ecosystem, we were encouraged to take the perspectives of company, people, context, business, technology and culture, and the experience drivers of holistic care environment,  independent and confident parenting, playful and supportive interactions,  healthy development and family-centered into consideration. I have focused on these aspects in the ideation and discussion of our ecosystem. We used them mostly as a guideline in helping us evaluating and analyzing our concept. In the end, it turned out to be the most convincing for Philips Design. It inspired me to pay attention on these perspectives and drivers when communicating designs in an company environment.</p>

            	<div id="deve">
                	<p>As the main focus has been put on the big picture of ecosystem in this module week, the concept of the Philips hub could be developed stronger. Considering that the product concept is also important for Philips because the ecosystem would be built on it, more details should be added to gave a concrete product concept. Besides, the six perspectives and five experience drivers could be used as a reference in other projects when designing the business system.</p>

        		<h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>It is a one week module of mechanical engineering which would gave a better understanding of sound mechanical design principles. We were required to apply the introduced knowledge to a design problem we experienced in previous projects.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>I chose this module in order to take a broader perspective in terms of integrated technology to further ground my position as a user experience designer. I was stepping out my comfort zone  as I have no experience in mechanical engineering before. I started my study in an explorative style in this module. As required, I picked a mechanical design problem in a concept product design of  a foldable chair to explore how  to redesign it by the newly gained mechanical knowledge.</p>

            	<div id="part-1">
                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Mechanics in design</span><br>By exploring to solve a realistic problem for my foldable stool, I was surprised that mechanism could affect the design form and users' experience as well.  As can been seen in others' design problems, delicate mechanical structures could solve a lot of problems happening in the functions area and optimized structure could also have an influence in improving the user experience of the design.  In the process of trying and making,  I found that a lot of ignored realistic problems would appear when prototype  an ideal concept, which indicates that how to make a design viable on mechanical aspect is also a crucial point for designer to pay attention.</p>

                <div id="part-2">
                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">A different approach of designing process</span><br>When trying to solve the problem in the concept, I did it in three iterations in a designer style. I first came up with solutions referring to the principles of exact constraint design and force closure that were introduced in the literatures of  'Elements of Mechanical Design'. After that, I tried them out to experience if they could solve the problem of foldable legs and elastic stool surface. Through the lecturer's feedback, I learned that it is different in mechanical design. Some calculations should be first done before execution in order to avoid non-ideal solutions and optimize the efficiency. This the first time I realized that strictness and preciseness are vital in design when it comes to mechanical aspect.</p>

            	<div id="deve">
                	<p>By trying out the thin gap and spiral line structure, I have gained some improvements to make the surface elastic when the users sit on it, but they are not pretty ideal solutions. So, the next step could be the experiments of integrating the spiral lines with the thin gaps.<br><br>In addition, a brief introduction about inherent properties of the material was gave in this module, which also talked about the process of transforming it from raw material to finished product. I got some inspiration that the exploration of material properties may also bring some new solutions to make the surface could be elastic from all directions. For instance, steel and silica gel.</p>

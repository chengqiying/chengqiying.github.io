                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>With the newly arisen technology, it has become feasible to monitor objective sleep data via various applications and wearable devices. Whereas, data from subjective monitoring is an indispensable branch for a complete picture of people’s sleep state. But subjective monitoring is not easy to proceed without obtrusiveness by using questionnaires and dairies.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>This project aims to explore digital and interactive solutions which could support people with sleep complaints in monitoring their sleep quality and sleep related behaviour in an unobtrusive manner and present an useful and lucid visulization which will let them easily understand and communicate their sleep states.</p>

            	<div id="part-1">
                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">User experience as a foothold</span><br>The biggest difference in this project is that the foothold is designing for user experience instead of solving a problem or satisfying a need for users. This is also the most important development for me in this semester. In the process of exploring how to bring an unobtrusive experience to users during monitoring sleep data, I gradually came to know that thoughtfulness is a key aspect to create pleasant experience. In this project, I got the chance to develop my skill to empathize user’s experience and design for it. By studying others’ designs and my own experience in this project, I found that form, emotional interaction and function details, are three vital factors which could influence the life span of an application from the perspective of user experience design.</p>

                <div id="part-2">
                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Learning new design methods</span><br>It was exciting to learn a new method and try to apply it in the design process to collect inspirations and generate ideas. Participatory design have taught me to do the ideation part from a new perspective. Non-designers’ involvement could activate a different design thinking in discussion. I could absorb their thoughts in the early stage of design and merge some of them into concepts, which has broadened my experience and skill of ideation as a user experience designer. By using participatory design, I also came to notice that the first version of design should be initially done by the designer, the value of user and others’ participation is to provide advice and inspirations for improvement and new features.</p>

                <div id="part-3">
                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Company environment</span><br><p>Another big development is learning to cooperate with a real client whose opinions would be involved in the process of design decisions making. This kind of communication and cooperation have enriched my experience of working in a company environment. For sure, I believe it would be helpful for me to get preparation for transferring my role from a student in school to an professional designer in workplace quickly.</p>

                	<p><p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Motion prototyping skill</span><br>I have been trying to express the three concepts vividly and exactly by exploring to visualize on different devices in a good quality, like iPhone and iPad. It was a nice practice for me to know the different concerns in terms of interaction and visualization on different devices. For a better presentation of the concepts, I learned to use a module code software-Quartz Composer to show them in animation.</p>

            	<div id="deve">
                	<p>Following, there will be a second round of iteration which includes the final concept and implementation, and two rounds of evaluation. I would start with the unobtrusive experience related paper reading for more inspirations in the second iteration. Together with the feedback of the three concepts in the first iteration from the experts and designers, I would summarize the features and come to a final concept. Based on that, implementation will be conducted afterwards.<br><br>With the implemented version of concept, I will begin to have a first round of user evaluation for the feedback of the experience of the application. After improvement, a second round of user evaluation will be taken for further feedback and improvement, which will help the application to bring user a more thoughtful and less unobtrusive experience in subjective sleep monitoring. </p>

        		<h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>It is a one week module which imparts an awareness of theories and methods that pertain to designing for children. The main activity is to learn how to apply elements from different schools of thought in developmental psychology to the design of products for children. Our task is to design for two target groups of 5-6 and 11-12 year old children, based on two given design cases: GlowSteps and Space Blocks.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>In accordance with my vision, I chose this module mainly because I expect to learn more methods that can be applied in user experience area. As I have little experience of designing for children, I want to explore the special design methods and theories of interaction design for children and see if there is a possibility to apply them  to design for other target users.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Applying theories and methods of interaction design for children in design process</span><br>By studying DSD cards, our group could come up with some initial design opportunities through empathising children’s behaviours in four domains. It was an efficient way for me to get familiar with a totally new target group(children) and seek for a few design needs in a fast iteration. As for Practices & Moods theory, we used it to analyse our personas which were created based on DSD cards and whereby we could better understand and describe children’s behaviour models in our personas. Also, knowledge in these two theories provided a strong support for our design decisions for children.<br><br>Further, the main idea I have learned from reading papers of  participatory design is that, in the early period of design, designer can already involve target users (children) in the design process to modify and also enrich the ways of interaction with the design. It is a good way to empathy users via designing together with them.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Empathizing users in three ways, by theory, observation and evaluation</span><br>Based on theories, I could empathize users from a more abstract level and get to know the supporting methods and backgrounds about the target users. DSD cards was used as a main guideline to see the aspects where I should empathize the children.<br><br>When observing children on a playground, I noticed that children’s behaviours could vary from different age groups due to their different levels of physical, social, cognitive and emotional capabilities. So, it is of necessity to take the age appropriateness into account when it comes to the detailed experience and interactions of a product or service.<br><br>In the process of testing our design with a low-fi prototype, the children were regarded as a design partner to help us define the specific interactions. It reminded me that concepts could be kept open and modified together with users in the early phase, because users’ inputs can help improve the concept fit target users well.</p>

                	<p>I have found an interesting design method(participatory design)which could be used in the early phase of design. I would try to it in my project when studying users and exploring the possible and appropriate ways of interaction between users and the design. I expect it could help me to break the limitation of comprehension of users and gain more useful feedback about the design. I would also consider using the practices and moods theory to look at the essence of users’ behaviour models and then look for design opportunities.</p>

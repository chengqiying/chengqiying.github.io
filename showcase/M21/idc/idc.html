                <p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Context: </span>With the newly arisen technology, it has become feasible to monitor objective sleep data via various applications and wearable devices. Whereas, data from subjective monitoring is an indispensable branch for a complete picture of people’s sleep state. But subjective monitoring is not easy to proceed without obtrusiveness by using questionnaires and dairies.<br><br><span style="color:#00BCD4">Goal: </span>In accordance with my vision, I chose this module mainly because I expect to learn more methods that can be applied in user experience area. As I have little experience of designing for children, I want to explore the special design methods and theories of interaction design for children and see if there is a possibility to apply them  to design for other target users.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Apply theories of interaction design for children in design process</span><br>By studying DSD cards, our group could come up with some initial design opportunities through empathising children’s behaviours in four domains. It was an efficient way for me to get familiar with a total new target group(children) and seek for a few design needs in a fast iteration. As for Practices & Moods. We used it to analyse our personas which were created based on DSD cards and whereby we could better understand and describe children’s behaviour models in our personas. Also, knowledge in these two theories could provide a strong support for our design decisions for children.<br><br>The main idea I have learned from reading papers of  participatory design is that, in the early period of design, designer can already involve target users (children) in the design process to modify and also enrich the ways of interaction with the design. It is a good way to empathy users via designing together with them.</p>

                	<p><span style="color:#00BCD4">Empathize users by theory, observation and evaluation</span><br>Based on theories, I could empathize users from a more abstract level and get to know the supporting methods and backgrounds about the target users. DSD cards was used as a main guideline to see the aspects where I should empathize the children.<br><br>When observing children on a playground, I noticed that children’s behaviours could vary from different age groups due to their different levels of physical, social, cognitive and emotional capabilities. So, it is of necessity to take the age appropriateness into account when it comes to the detailed experience and interactions of a product or service.<br><br>When testing our design with a low-fi prototype, the children were regarded as a design partner to define the specific interactions. It reminded me that concepts could be kept open and modified together with users in the early phase, because users’ inputs can help improve the concept fit target users well.</p>

            	<div id="deve">
                	<p>I would try to apply participatory design method in my project when studying users and exploring the possible and appropriate ways of interaction between users and the design. It could help me to break the limitation of comprehension of users and gain more useful feedback about the design. I would also consider using the practices and moods theory to analyse users’ behaviour models and look for design opportunities.</p>

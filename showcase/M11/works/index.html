				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>The client of this project is ING (International Netherland Group). ING’s mission is to set the standard in helping 
				its customers manage their financial future. ING aims to deliver its financial products and services in the way its customers want them delivered: with exemplary service, convenience and at competitive prices.</p>
				<p>Aligned with the needs of customers and the client (ING), this project designs a social media feedback system for ING. The goal of this project is to 
				give customers the impression that their feedback is valued and appreciated by the bank, meanwhile help the bank make efficient use of the feedback from customers. This projects works on a social media platform, and one of the most popular social media, Facebook, is a trial in the project for this semester.</p>

					<h2>Activities</h2>
					<div id="ac1">
						<h3>Service design methods</h3>
						<p>Have experienced this project, I learnt that it is vital for 
						service designer to pick an apropriate tool to present the 
						design concept as service design is an interdiscinplinary 
						approach which combines different methods and tools from various 
						discinplines. Indeed, I have grasped a few tools throughout 
						this semester. Storyboard played an improtant role in the process 
						of the project. I used it to ananlyze the current situation, 
						prototyped my concepts and make comparison between them. which 
						helped to communicate with users, expertise and client, and get 
						feedback from them. Apart from that, Animation , video and Prezi are 
						also the important tools in this project. Animation clearly 
						shows the dynamic process of feedback changing. Prezi 
						and video demonstrate the holistic concept.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="ac2">
						<h3>Integrate different stakeholders</h3>
						<p>Various stakeholders are involved in a certain service. 
						The ING users, ING and its staff and the social media 
						platform are the main stakeholders in this project. I 
						fousced more on the ING users and ING, and at the same time 
						took the other stakeholders into considration. I can see how 
						it helped me to get insights and inspiration in different 
						iterations of the design. The new solutions came  out from 
						integrating the customer's and client&#39;s actual needs. 
						I realized in my project that sometimes it would not be easy for deaigners to well combine the 
						needs from both sides, I learnt to put the related stakeholders together on one map, and keep 
						the bid picture in mind throughout every step.</p>

						<h3>Related literatures</h3>
						<p>At he beginning of the project, I spent some time reading the book "This Is Service Design". With this book, 
						I got the first understanding of what is service design 
						and realized that it is a burgeoning interdicsipline. In order to get 
						inspirations,I searched the related articles online to 
						study how the service design company (e.g. Engine)conduct a project. I would come to this book when confused about the methods and ways to deliver service design concept. 
						I learnt the approaches of using stakeholder maps and 
						storyboard from it. As for the storyboard, I gained deep 
						and detailed skills to present the concept with 
						storyboard effectively from the book:"Sketching User Experiences". </p>

    				<h1>Reflection</h1>
    				<p>I took this project as a start of learning service 
					design. With the support of my coach, I have a better 
					understanding of service design by the exploration in this 
					project. As far as I am concerned now, service design is 
					about efficiently planning and organizing all the elements 
					in a certain service, in order to improve user experience 
					and service quality. There are two vital ponits, one is user 
					experience centered in every step of design. The other one 
					is to bring the design into practice. Morevoer, I have 
					grasped a course of service design tools which 
					helped gain insights and feedback in the process of service design. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Reviewing the process from Ideation to the final results, 
					I am very exciting that I have achieved th goals set for 
					service design at the start. I have developed 
					my competencies of User Focus and Perspective, Form and 
					Senses, Idea and Concept and Business Process Design. As 
					the communication with the cilent was not enough, which 
					resulted in the weak improvement in Business Design in the 
					project. However I gianed extra experience of it in the module 
					DB514, so that I could applied it in future learning 
					activities. </p>

				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>The client of this project is ING (International Netherland Group). ING’s mission is to set the standard in helping our customers manage their financial future. ING aims to deliver its financial products and services in the way its customers want them delivered: with exemplary service, convenience and at competitive prices.</p>
				<p>Aligned with the needs of customers and the client (ING), this project designs a social media feedback system for ING. The goal of this project is to make customers feel that their feedback is valued and appreciated by the bank, and meanwhile help the bank make efficient use of the feedback from customers. This projects works on a social media platform, and one of the most popular social media, Facebook is a trial in the project for this semester.</p>

					<h2>Activities</h2>
					<div id="ac1">
						<h3>Service design methods</h3>
						<p>Have experienced this project, I learned that it is vital for 
						service designer to pick an apropriate tool to present the 
						design concept as service design is an interdiscinplinary 
						approach which combines different methods and tools from various 
						discinplines. Indeed, I have learned a few tools throughout 
						this semester. Storyboard played an improtant role in the process 
						of the project. I used it to ananlyzed the current situation, 
						prototyped my concepts and made comparison between them. which 
						helped to communicate with users, expertise and client and get 
						feedback from them. Apart from that, Animation , video and Prezi are 
						also the important tools in this project. Animation clearly 
						shows the dynamic process of feedback changing. Prezi 
						and video demonstrate the holistic concept.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="ac2">
						<h3>Integrate different stakeholders</h3>
						<p>Various stakeholders are involved in a certain service. 
						The ING users, ING and its staff and the social media 
						platform are the main stakeholders in this project. I 
						fousced more on the ING users and ING, and at the same time 
						took the other stakeholders into considration. I can see how 
						it helped me to get insights and inspiration in different 
						interations of the design. The new solutions came  out from 
						integrating the customer and client&#39;s actual needs. I 
						learned to put the related stakeholders together on one map, and keep 
						the bid picture in mind throughout every step.</p>

						<h5>Building my personal website</h5>
						<p>With no konwledge and experience of building and designing a website, I started to learn HTML and CSS for the preparation 
						of my personal website and showcase website. Through learning on the online 
						shcool (&quot;w3cschool&quot;) and reading some related articles 
						about the skills of web design, I tried to design my own 
						website and obtained the knowledge of web design, such 
						as HTML5 &amp; CSS3 and graphic design in web. I felt lucky 
						that this kind of self-directed learning offered time 
						and space for me to arrange my own learning schedule.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="web2">
					<div id="web2-text">
						<p>In the process of personal website design,&nbsp; I 
						got another chance to look back to my previous design 
						works. I could rethink about all the works and what I 
						have learnt from them. The precious works trained me for 
						the basic skills of a designer. It was an explorative 
						journey for me to figure out my on direction in design, and now I am growing up into a designer with professional skills.</p>

						<h5>Adapting to new environment</h5>
						<p>As it is my first semester of master here in TU/e, 
						the first priority is to adapt myselft into the new 
						education environment as well as the different culture. 
						It was literally not an easy thing for me at the 
						beginning, but I was gradually used to the new 
						environment with time gonging by. I learnt the 
						difference between western and estern culture through my 
						owm experience with fellow students, coaches and other 
						people around me. I really apreciate that these 
						experience hepls me grow to maturity.</p>
						<p>Being rational is the most obvious&nbsp; character of 
						westeren people, which leads them to do things driven by 
						a clear goal. Coming from a total different background, 
						I was confused by this kind of thinking and felt very 
						hard to figure out the specific vision and identity of 
						myself. Nevertheless, it turned out to be a good chance for 
						me to seriously think about my plans and goals as a designer, 
						and arrange the suitable learning activities for achieving them.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="adapt2">
					<div id="adapt2-text">
						<p>Another big difference is the way people get along with each other. Independence is vital. 
						In terms of the study in TU, through the teamwork in this semester, although I encountered some trouble 
						in the process, but I have learnt 
						the way how students work in a team after the effrorts I 
						made, which offers tips 
						for me to collaborate beeter with the group in next 
						semester. Besides, it widens my eyes on the 
						understanding of the local culture and people.m Thannks 
						to this experience, I could learn to think critically and behave with more easiness when 
						treating different people.</p>
						<p>The whole semester is  a great opportunity for me, as 
						a new international student here, to get familiar with the educational environment, from how to 
						communicate with the coaches and students to how to use 
						the facilities in the learning activities, such as the 
						photostudio, all the machines in vertigo, the service 
						desk, etc.</p>

						<h5>Dutch design week</h5>
						<p>During the Dutch Design week, I went to Van Abbemuseum, Design 
						Acdamic Eindhoven, TU/e and the clock building  to see the exhibitions. 
						This was a great time to see various designs from 
						different areas. The two most impressive are the 
						graduation exhibition in DAE and one design related to emotion expression in TU. I 
						could see the works designed from a more artistic perspective in DAE, which provided another angle to creat and appreciate design.</p>

					<div id="week-text">
						<p>The design in TU showed a emtion board to capture and 
						express people&#39;s different levels of happiness, which 
						was an inspiraiton that might can be used in service 
						design. I was glad to have a chance to communicate with 
						other designers and get to konw their design motivations 
						on the exhibitons. After visiting this exhibiitons and 
						seeing various kinds of design works, I learnt that the 
						details and user-centered dicsipline are crucial in 
						design. </p>

						<h5>Design trip</h5>
						<p>I was very exciting to take this design trip to 
						northern Europe. I got the opportunity to be close to 
						the nordic desing which I have heard since I knew 
						industrial design. It was really amazing to see these 
						works of design and art. Especially in industrial 
						design, I got to know how the design style is formed, 
						how well they can integrate function and aesthetic, and 
						even how the design thinking is carried in the design.</p>

				<div id="trip2">
					<div id="trip2-text">
						<p>I have been appealed to the Schroder house and the famous red-bule chair. It is a fantastic design 
						which perfectly make use of the space of the house. This 
						classical design represents a kind of Stijl design style 
						in Netherland.</p>
						<p>After these design trips, I got a better 
						understanding of the nordic desing and culture, Dutch 
						design and culture. I would treat it a chance to broaden 
						my horizon in design history.</p>

						<h5>Reading books</h5>
						<p>As mentioned in my goals, I planned to focus on service design this semester. Service design is an 
						new area for me, so I 
						scheduled some time to read the related book &quot;This Is 
						Service Design Thinking&quot; to enrich my knowledge 
						about it. From this book, I gained the theoretical 
						knowledge and learnt some tools which I could apply in 
						my project. It was a big help for me in the process of 
						the project.</p>
						<p>Apart from that, I also read another book "Design Thinking" in order to  
						increase my theoretical knowledge of design, which could 
						improve the ability of&nbsp; design thinking. </p>

						<h5>Module Introduction</h5>
						<p><span>It is a one week module which targets on 
						Designing Business Processes, Design and Research 
						Processes, Self-directed and Continuous Learning. We 
						learn to design in an given context and go beyond the 
						context where radical innovation opportunities can be 
						created, also learn the skills to express and 
						communicate the innovation opportunities to 
						stakeholders.</span></p>
					</div>
					<div id="modulebackground2">
						<p>With the expections of<span> getting familiar with 
						business processe and how to apply it in the design, and 
						how to appropriately communicate the design with client, 
						I choose this module as a chance to learn.&nbsp; 
						Starting the project in a team of six, by overcoming 
						various setbacks together, we successfully finished the 
						task of design products targeting on elderly people for 
						Vogel&#39;s.</span></p>

						<h5>Concept</h5>
						<p>We strarted with a few quick brainstorms and 
						presented the 
						general idea in the midterm of this week. With the 
						feedback and advice gotten from Vogel&#39;s and expertise, 
						we rethink about the concept and changed it&nbsp; to a 
						mechanical systems that improve the ergonomics of the 
						kitchen, and enhance the accessibility of cooking 
						utensils and appliances in new kitchens, which can 
						quickly but smoothly lifts the entire content of the 
						drawer into John’s reach.</p>

						<h5>Communication with client</h5>
						<p>Cooperated with the client, Vogel&#39;s, I took this as a 
						chance to learn to communicate with real client as I 
						have little exeperience before. In the process, I find 
						that a convincing way to express the innovaiton 
						opportunity to a client is to bring out enough evidence 
						and the practical design which aligned with their needs 
						and profit.</p>

						<h5>Video expression</h5>
						<p>In process of this module, we presented the&nbsp; 
						finding and ideas all by videos. The first one tended to 
						show the insights we obtained from field research. The 
						rest two were designed to domenstrate the general and 
						final concepts for Vogel&#39;s. I realized that video is&nbsp; 
						a good choice to show the idea to the client as a vivid 
						way, which could not only give a deep impression, but 
						also provideds the visual material to communicate with 
						both client and expertise.&nbsp;From the persective of 
						designers, it really improved the skill of&nbsp; 
						integrating the elements together to express the 
						complete design. </p>

						<h5>Target user research</h5>
						<p>This time the group we decided to design for was active older adults who will increasingly need support as they get older. 
						I learnt to experience the elderly&#39;s feelings by drawing 
						the&nbsp; one day in life map, imagining that what the 
						life would be like when I was 65 years old. It is a new 
						way to slip into the user&#39;s shoes to dig out the needs, 
						which is different from the previous which only analyzes 
						the current elderly people&#39;s life. Treat the elderly 
						people as a group who also want to look sexy and 
						fashionable.</p>

						<h4>Design business process</h4>
						<p>I really appreciated that I could have an experience with a real client in the design process, which is lacked in my previous study. In the process, the assignments of this module and feedback from client made me seriously consider the business process of a designed product or service. I learned that for a real company, the only innovation is far from enough. How to incorporate with different stakeholders is crucial for the success of the product or service. Also, the financial issues needed to be taken into account in the design process, because that is a key aspect for a company to decide whether the new design is valuable to invest. This would be important for me to apply into continued study.</p>

					<div id="uf">
						<h4>User focus and perspective</h4>
						<p>Sensing from different perspectives is very important, especially the user’s. When considering the user, I learned to use the tool “a day in life” to analyze users’ experience and find out the design point. When considering the market, I learned to take the business model canvas to think about the ways these stakeholders were incorporated. In this module, our target group was the elderly people. It seemed that the normal way to understand the elderly was to interview them. However, I found that another good way was to imagine that when I was a 70 years old woman, what my life would be like. This kind of way to experience the user could bring the user insights which were easily to be neglected.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="tm">
						<h4>Teamwork and communication</h4>
						<p>It was my first time to be engaged in a group of six students here in TU/e, five of which are Dutch.  And at the beginning, it was indeed a challenge for me to integrate into them. After thinking about the different backgrounds of us, I realized that I may should first try to adapt to this kind of teamwork and then put forward the suggestion of task plan. So, I felt more integrated afterwaards.</p>

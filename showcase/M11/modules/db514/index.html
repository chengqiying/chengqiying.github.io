						<h5>Module Introduction</h5>
						<p>It is a two-week module focusing on Form and Senses, Integrating Technology and User Focus and Perspective. I would take this module as an adaptive process of my study in TU/e, which is an opportunity for me to get familiar with the academic environment, and to learn about how the students in TU/e do design.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="modulebackground2">
						<p>Through making physical prototype, it will be much easier for me to present ideas, communicate with others and revise the concepts in time. Besides, it can enlarge my knowledge in form and senses related with user behaviors. I think in some extent, this module can widen my design perspective for being a service designer.</p>

						<h5>Concept</h5>
						<p>We got six concepts after the first brainstorm. We picked the “Knocking box” after comparation and made a simple prototype to test. But the sound changing was so subtle that we gave up this concept. Therefore we chose the rolling belt in the end as it was simple and suited the theme of changing behavior.</p>

						<h5>Implementation process</h5>
						<p>At first, we made a physical sketch to find out the appropriate construction of the box. Then, we used paper and cloth of various thicknesses to find out the smoothest one. After that, we made the first prototype to test the basic movement. In order to enhance the smoothness of movement, we change the construction of wheels. In the final prototype, we added another up board for the appearance of box and improve the tidiness of inside.</p>

						<h5>Behavior exploration</h5>
						<p>We can accelerate the belt with touching. It goes fast in the same direction with touching when touching fast and slowly when touching slowly. It goes longer when touching with more pressure. It also can be stopped when touching again. And, there is a bonus sound effect when the belt stops in a high speed.</p>

						<h5>Reflection</h5>

						<h4>Design business process</h4>
						<p>I really appreciated that I could have an experience with a real client in the design process, which is lacked in my previous study. In the process, the assignments of this module and feedback from client made me seriously consider the business process of a designed product or service. I learned that for a real company, the only innovation is far from enough. How to incorporate with different stakeholders is crucial for the success of the product or service. Also, the financial issues needed to be taken into account in the design process, because that is a key aspect for a company to decide whether the new design is valuable to invest. This would be important for me to apply into continued study.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="uf">
						<h4>Uer focus and perspective</h4>
						<p>Sensing from different perspectives is very important, especially the user’s. When considering the user, I learned to use the tool “a day in life” to analyze users’ experience and find out the design point. When considering the market, I learned to take the business model canvas to think about the ways these stakeholders were incorporated. In this module, our target group was the elderly people. It seemed that the normal way to understand the elderly was to interview them. However, I found that another good way was to imagine that when I was a 70 years old woman, what my life would be like. This kind of way to experience the user could bring the user insights which were easily to be neglected.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="tm">
						<h4>Teamwork and communication</h4>
						<p>It was my first time to be engaged in a group of six students here in TU/e, five of which are Dutch.  And at the beginning, it was indeed a challenge for me to integrate into them. After thinking about the different backgrounds of us, I realized that I may should first try to adapt to this kind of teamwork and then put forward the suggestion of task plan. So, I felt more integrated afterwaards.</p>

						<h5>Module Introduction</h5>
						<p>It is a two-week module focusing on Form and Senses, Integrating Technology and User Focus and Perspective. I would take this module as a 
						first adaptive process of my study in TU/e, which is an opportunity for me to get familiar with the academic environment, and to learn about how the students in TU/e do design.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="modulebackground2">
						<p>Through making physical prototype, it becomes much 
						easier for me to present ideas, communicate with others 
						and revise the concepts in time. Besides, it enlarged my 
						knowledge in form and senses related with user 
						behaviors. Also, I learnt to use design thoery to 
						support the design process .</p>

						<h5>Concept</h5>
						<p>We got six concepts after the quick brainstorm. We picked the “Knocking box” after comparation and made a simple prototype to test. But the sound changing was so subtle that we gave up this concept. Therefore we chose the rolling belt in the end as it was simple and suited the theme of changing behavior.</p>

					<div id="imp-text">
						<h5>Implementation process</h5>
						<p>Aming at a simple and smoonth interaction, we improved the structure of the box and tried belts with different materials, e.g. paper and cloth. At first, we made a physical sketch to find out the appropriate construction of the box. In order to enhance the smoothness of movement, we change the construction of wheels. In the final prototype, we added another up board for the appearance of box and improve the tidiness of inside. I paid a lot attentions on the details of the form of the box in the process. Through this, I felt that the practical prototypes helped a lot in communicaiton with others. I also realized that good designs come with quantities of attempts.</p>

				<div id="behavior">
					<div id="beh-text">
						<h5>Behavior exploration</h5>
						<p>We explored several kind of behaviors for the user to 
						interacte with the box, which were tested, compared and 
						improved. We both agree that the interaction should be 
						simple and pure. The belt on the box can be accelerated 
						and decelerated with different touching speed. It goes longer when touching with more pressure. It also can be stopped when touching again. 
						In addition, there is a bonus sound effect when the belt stops in a high speed. 
						I can see the importance of user when analyzing the 
						interaction behaviors. I experienced again that the best 
						way to improve the interaction is to slip into the 
						user&#39;s shoes at various times.</p>

						<h4>Design theory</h4>
						<p><span>I have learned from the theory that the 
						affordance of the design objects is very important. 
						Interaction between users and design needs an 
						invitation. So, I tried to use these points to support 
						my design thinking when explored and discussed the 
						behaviors between the box and users.</span></p>
					</div>
					<div id="fi">
						<h4>Form integration</h4>
						<p>At first, it was an exercise of form integration without a specific aim. I tried to create with small cubes and circles in order to pursue a harmony like yin and yang. In the end, I decided to make a wave surface by using the thin sticks. Looking back to this sector, I find this aimless form exercise can help me to explore more possibilities about shape changing. It indeed provided with me a new way to improve my form and senses competency.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="dp">
						<h4>Design process</h4>
						<p>The most important point is that I could learn from making physical prototype which I would seldom did before. Through the physical stuff, it is much easier to communicate with others and present the design concepts. In the process of making physical stuff, we could come across the problems which haven’t been considered in the concept and find solutions in time. This is better for the improvement of the design. The implementation of concept is a very significant process for me in this module.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="t">
						<h4>Teamework and communication</h4>
						<p>In general, it is a smooth process with cooperation with Vleer Doing who is good at mechanism and programming. I would care more about the design details and beauty. In this group, I tried my efforts to communicate whit my partner because we have very different background and interests. This really improved my team and communication competency.</p>

						<h5>Module Introduction</h5>
						<p>It is a two-week module focusing on Form and Senses, Integrating Technology and User Focus and Perspective. I would take this module as an adaptive process of my study in TU/e, which is an opportunity for me to get familiar with the academic environment, and to learn about how the students in TU/e do design.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="modulebackground2">
						<p>Through making physical prototype, it will be much easier for me to present ideas, communicate with others and revise the concepts in time. Besides, it can enlarge my knowledge in form and senses related with user behaviors. I think in some extent, this module can widen my design perspective for being a service designer.</p>

						<h5>Concept</h5>
						<p>We got six concepts after the first brainstorm. We picked the “Knocking box” after comparation and made a simple prototype to test. But the sound changing was so subtle that we gave up this concept. Therefore we chose the rolling belt in the end as it was simple and suited the theme of changing behavior.</p>

					<div id="imp-text">
						<h5>Implementation process</h5>
						<p>At first, we made a physical sketch to find out the appropriate construction of the box. Then, we used paper and cloth of various thicknesses to find out the smoothest one. After that, we made the first prototype to test the basic movement. In order to enhance the smoothness of movement, we change the construction of wheels. In the final prototype, we added another up board for the appearance of box and improve the tidiness of inside.</p>

					<div id="beh-text">
						<h5>Behavior exploration</h5>
						<p>We can accelerate the belt with touching. It goes fast in the same direction with touching when touching fast and slowly when touching slowly. It goes longer when touching with more pressure. It also can be stopped when touching again. And, there is a bonus sound effect when the belt stops in a high speed.</p>

						<h4>Design theory</h4>
						<p>It is a two-week module focusing on Form and Senses, Integrating Technology and User Focus and Perspective. I would take this module as an adaptive process of my study in TU/e, which is an opportunity for me to get familiar with the academic environment, and to learn about how the students in TU/e do design.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="fi">
						<h4>Form integration</h4>
						<p>At first, it was an exercise of form integration without a specific aim. I tried to create with small cubes and circles in order to pursue a harmony like yin and yang. In the end, I decided to make a wave surface by using the thin sticks. Looking back to this sector, I find this aimless form exercise can help me to explore more possibilities about shape changing. It indeed provided with me a new way to improve my form and senses competency.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="dp">
						<h4>Design process</h4>
						<p>The most important point is that I could learn from making physical prototype which I would seldom did before. Through the physical stuff, it is much easier to communicate with others and present the design concepts. In the process of making physical stuff, we could come across the problems which haven’t been considered in the concept and find solutions in time. This is better for the improvement of the design. The implementation of concept is a very significant process for me in this module.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="t">
						<h4>Teamework and communication</h4>
						<p>In general, it is a smooth process with cooperation with Vleer Doing who is good at mechanism and programming. I would care more about the design details and beauty. In this group, I tried my efforts to communicate whit my partner because we have very different background and interests. This really improved my team and communication competency.</p>

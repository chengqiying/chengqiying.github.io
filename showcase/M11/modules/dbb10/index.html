						<h5>Module Introduction</h5>
						<p>It is a one week module which puts emphasis on 
						design research process. I think I would have a chance 
						to improve my ability of design research through the 
						exercises in this module, which contributes to 
						understanding users as well as the design itself.&nbsp; 
						The research is divided into three directions as field, 
						lab and showroom. In order to learn professional 
						research approaches in practical context, I chose the 
						topic of field.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="modulebackground2">
						<p>With the given theme of Greed and Charity, a research 
						process was conducted by our group to find out the 
						people&#39;s different behaviours which could be
						manifested as greed or charity in interactions with 
						vending machines in society.</span> I really enjoyed th 
						process of this module to work together with the group 
						to search an learn the research methods for field.</p>

						<h5>Concept</h5>
						<p>A classical vending machine has been chosen as the 
						interactive platform for this field study. In this field 
						research an additional device has been added to an 
						existing vending machine in order to test peoples’ 
						reaction and behaviour when offered free additional free 
						candy, after their purchase has been collected. The goal 
						of the field research is to develop knowledge about 
						people’s behaviour and what influences their decisionto 
						take action for taken the additional free candy or not. 
						Various (internal and external) factors can influence 
						people’s behaviour in deciding to take the additional 
						candy or not.</p>

						<h5>Analysis method</h5>
						<p>A“Qualitative Data Analysis Methods” were used to 
						interpret and guide the process of the experiment to 
						come to a proper outcome. With the recommendation on the 
						open and closed coding methodsfrom Qualitative field 
						research expert Panos Markopoulos, I learnt&nbsp; the 
						method together with other fellow members in order to&nbsp; 
						synthesise a coherent picture from disparate data. We 
						gathered data by video taking, obervation and interview 
						afterwards. In data analysis, all information is 
						summarized into annotated chunks. These chunks are then 
						coded into categories of frequent observations. 
						Recurring themes, rules and relationships are labeled as 
						memos. These aspects describe explanations and personal 
						interpretations of the events during the experiment, 
						from which we get conclusions of the research 
						question:&quot;What influence people to be greedy?&quot;</p>

						<h5>Research experiment</h5>
						<p>The experiment is conducted from a piolet test, and 
						follwoed by three kind of prototypes. The final 
						prototype was placed on the chosen vending machine in 
						the Auditorium to provoke participants to decide whether 
						to take additional <br />
						free candy or not. In the process of experiment, I 
						learnt that the most improtant point of field research 
						is to observe participants&#39; behaviors in a natural 
						context. The test has been done by one half of the team 
						in order to do a single blind analysis on the test 
						results.</p>

						<h5>Reflection</h5>
						<p>In this module, I was in the group of field research. I chose this direction because I want to learn more about focusing on users in a real context. After this one week, I indeed have learned a lot about how to do a field research. Also, in the final presentation and discussion, I learned from the other two groups: lab and showroom, and had a fair understanding of the ways of research in these two directions.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="fr">
						<h4>Field research</h4>
						<p>As for me, I didn’t have much experience about field research before. And now, I think I know that the core of field research is capturing participants’ natural behavior and interaction with the design in the context. In order to gather qualitative data, video recording, observations and following interviews can be taken. Also the analysis of these behaviors is an important part of the research after data gathering. For the analysis of our field research, we used qualitative data analysis methods (open and closed coding methods) to synthesize a coherent picture from disparate data. Through this method the analysis would go beyond summarizing and onto interpretations, to ensure that conclusions drawn are more reliable and useful.In the process of our field research, I learned that for a research goal, the prototype is not the most crucial part of the research. More focus should be put on the sections of data gathering and analysis.</p>	
					</div>
					<div id="sl">
						<h4>Showroom and lab research</h4>
						<p>In the discussion, I got a basic understanding of how to conduct a research in lab, and how to gather and analysis quantitative data from the lab group. In some extent, Lab research is the extension of field research, which can get more quantitative evidence for the factors founded in field research.From the showroom group, I learned that trigger participants to think and discuss about these design in the further.</p>

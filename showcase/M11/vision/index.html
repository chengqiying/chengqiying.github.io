    					<p>In my vision, design promotes comfort and elegance. My intention in design is to help people live more easily and comfortably. Nowadays, the overwhelming numbers of new things (e.g. technologies, new media and systems) have filled people’s lives. What I am interested in is how to assist people to adjust to these changes and challenges through design.

						<p>When I first went to the IKEA in Shanghai, I was amazed by the sales model. It offers a very comfortable and pleasing shopping experience through the samples exhibition area. It is a quite different experience from the current Chinese market. After that, I would pay more attention on the new experience around, e.g. the online bank. I find that these experiences are part of service design. So, I wish I could transform my role from a user to a service designer.

    					<p>As a designer, I want to focus on creating services which are more concerned about processes and systems. In order to become a qualified service designer, an ability of observing daily life and finding out complaints and dissatisfactions about currently organized services is vital at the beginning of this design journey. The design process includes enhancing customer experience and improving business performance across a wide range of industries and sectors. 
    					</p>

						<p>At the end of the master’s, I would have grown into a qualified designer with a wide perspective and professional design skills. I wish to work in a design consulting company (e.g. IDEO, Livework, Engine and Wolff Olins) as a designer to provide optimized service for clients from various industries.

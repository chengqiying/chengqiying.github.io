						<h5>Previous</h5>
						<p>With no konwledge and experience of building and designing a website, I started to learn HTML and CSS for the preparation 
						of my personal website and showcase website. Through learning on the online 
						shcool (&quot;w3cschool&quot;) and reading some related articles 
						about the skills of web design, I tried to design my own 
						website and obtained the knowledge of web design, such 
						as HTML5 &amp; CSS3 and graphic design in web. I felt lucky 
						that this kind of self-directed learning offered time 
						and space for me to arrange my own learning schedule.</p>

						<h5>Present</h5>
						<p>As it is my first semester of master here in TU/e, 
						the first priority is to adapt myselft into the new 
						education environment as well as the different culture. 
						It was literally not an easy thing for me at the 
						beginning, but I was gradually used to the new 
						environment with time gonging by. I learnt the 
						difference between western and estern culture through my 
						owm experience with fellow students, coaches and other 
						people around me. I really apreciate that these 
						experience hepls me grow to maturity.</p>

						<p>During the Dutch Design week, I went to Van Abbemuseum, Design 
						Acdamic Eindhoven, TU/e and the clock building  to see the exhibitions. 
						This was a great time to see various designs from 
						different areas. The two most impressive are the 
						graduation exhibition in DAE and one design related to emotion expression in TU. I 
						could see the works designed from a more artistic perspective in DAE, which provided another angle to creat and appreciate design.</p>

						<h5>Future plan</h5>
						<p>I was very exciting to take this design trip to 
						northern Europe. I got the opportunity to be close to 
						the nordic desing which I have heard since I knew 
						industrial design. It was really amazing to see these 
						works of design and art. Especially in industrial 
						design, I got to know how the design style is formed, 
						how well they can integrate function and aesthetic, and 
						even how the design thinking is carried in the design.</p>

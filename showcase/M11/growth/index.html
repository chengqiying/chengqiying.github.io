						<h5>Previous</h5>
						<p>In my bachelor deucation of industrial design, the 
						emphasis was put on ideal and concept trainning together 
						with the related fundamental skills (sketch, modeling by 
						rihno, graphic design, some basic electronic&nbsp; 
						knowledge and grogramming). It literally shaped my 
						design thinking, but there were less chance to gain the 
						experience of realistic design project which is vital to 
						my fututre career. As mentioned in my goals, faced with 
						the new competency based education system in TU/e, the 
						crucial thing I lack is learning with the specific 
						targets according to personal development plan. At the 
						beginning of this first semester, I set a vision of 
						service design although little experience of it because 
						I want to get to know about it and hope to be competent 
						in this area in the future.</p>

						<h5>Present</h5>
						<p>When kick-starting the study here, I firstly made the 
						persoanl development plan(PDP) which played a role of 
						guiding in the whole semester. After setting service 
						design as a main vision, I expected to my competency in&nbsp; 
						User Focus Perspective, Form and Senses and Business 
						Design Process from the aspect of service design. 
						Meanwhile,, from the perspective of learning ability, I 
						also planed to develop my competency in 
						Self-Directed and Continous Learning, Teamwork and 
						Communication and Integrated Technology.</p>

						<h5>Future plan</h5>
						<p>Above all, I plan to read more literatures and cases 
						about service design in order to get deeper 
						understanding of it, as my knowledge of service design 
						is not strong enough after the study of this semester. I 
						expect to shape my service design thinking through this 
						activities because I am new to this potentical design 
						area. I also plan to explore the possible and suitable 
						approaches to deliver the servide design concept.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Secondly, experienced the teamworks with fellow 
						student and communicaiton with coaches in modules and 
						project. Considering the work I have done in the team, I 
						feel that I just get used to the ways to work with 
						students from the different culture, so I expect to be 
						more active and possitive in the teamwork in the coming 
						semester.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>For the next semester, I will start the research 
						project which is indeed a chanllenge for me as I have no 
						such experience before. But I am still looking forward 
						to it because the research process is pretty essentical 
						for a logical design thinking. It is important for me, 
						as a designer, to grab the reseach methods for the 
						evaluation of the design, which could be applied in the 
						real desing works.</p>

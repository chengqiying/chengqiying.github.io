    					<p>Looking back to my previous training of design, I was trained in problem-based design thinking, focusing on concepts and ideas. This helped me to develop the ability to brainstorm in design. Obviously, my design capabilities have reached a certain level through the training in Bachelor’s (e.g. ideation, visualization), but the design process still needs to improve to be more sound and integrated. 
    					</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The biggest difference at the TU/e is the crucial role of personal development. I have never figured out clearly what kind of personal goals I should achieve through the design tasks I have done. The totally different education model here forces me to think more about the target competencies before starting the design work, and to check whether or not competency development has indeed been accomplished afterwards.

    				<div class="text">
    					<p>First of all, in order to enhance the efficiency of design work, I need to form a habit of making a schedule of the design process as I have been used to spending more time on ideation than on the rest parts of design work. Moreover, I have realized that self-directed learning should go beyond the passive study. This kind of learning will surely bring me self-exploring and true pleasure. 
    					</p>

						<p>Below are the competency areas I want to focus on and improve in this semester. There are two parts of the competencies. <a href="#part1">Part1</a> is for learning ability and <a href="#part2">Part2</a> is for service design ability.

    							<h2>Self-Directed & Continuous Learning</h2>
								<p>As independent thinking and learning are very important in the growth of a designer, I am eager to improve my self-directed & continuous learning capability. The crucial point is to plan a reasonable schedule for self–directed time to ensure the study efficiency (e.g. the self-directed learning weeks).</p>
    						</div>
    						<div id="it">
    							<h2>Integrating Technology</h2>
    							<p>I am capable to make an interactive prototype with the help of Arduino and Processing. What I lack and want to learn is making a personal showcase with HTML/CSS. I plan to learn the basic knowledge of HTML/CSS during the self-directed weeks and in normal weeks.</p>
    						</div>
    						<div id="tc">
    							<h2>Teamwork & Communication</h2>
    							<p>Coming here with a distinct background culture and language, it is indeed a challenge for me to communicate fluently with my fellows and coach in order to reach proper understanding. Communication skills and the English level are two key points I plan to improve through practicing talking to English speakers, watching design related TED talks(e.g. “Designers-think big!” by Tim Brown) and reading books(e.g. “Design Thinking”). Besides, I will try to get feedback from coaches with different expertise, which can provide me with various angles to improving my design.</p>

    							<h2>Designing Business Process</h2>
								<p>As I know, designed things need to be connected with a business process. In my past learning, I have added a business development plan into my design project. When I evaluate it now, I found the business development is not based on enough real data and information which led to defects in the business process. And in service design, understanding the business process of clients is the priority action. I expect to grasp more knowledge about the design business through reading related books and module DB514 Activating your Innovation Radar.</p>
    						</div>
    						<div id="fs">
    							<h2>Form & Senses</h2>
    							<p>Looking back to my study in the Bachelor’s, I have a good development in visualizing my thoughts. During the process of design, I would always pay lots of attention on the form and senses of my design work (include graphic, physical). I will keep working on this because it is my belief that aesthetic is also an important aspect of design which can influence the overall feeling of designed objects included products, systems and service. In module DB620 GHOST, I wish to learn more about form integration.</p>
    						</div>
    						<div id="ufp">
    							<h2>User Focus & Perspective</h2>
    							<p>I have learned that the user is the core of a design product, system or service as designed things are created to serve people. In the projects I have done in my Bachelor’s, there were actually some user researches contained in every project (for instance, interview, observation, scenarios and role playing), but I think the depth is not enough. For a sound design process, I should conduct this part in a more professional way and get more useful feedbacks after analyzing. I want to improve the quality of user research and make it more convincing through module DBB10 Constructive Design Research: From the Lab, Field and Showroom, because a well understanding of users is vital in service design.</p>

     <p>In my vision, design promotes comfort and elegance. My intention in design is to help people live more easily and comfortably. Nowadays, the overwhelming numbers of new things (e.g. technologies, new media and systems) have brought lots of changes and challenges to people’s lives. What I am interested in is how to assist people to get used to them through user&#45;centered service design. As an emerging discipline in industrial design, service design is attractive to me because its combination of interdisciplinary creativity, design and business. It belongs to design but also goes beyond design. The service design thinking requires to form a holistic map in mind as it is an evolving and complex approach.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><span id="u191-4">In the new era of industrial design, focus is transferring from product itself to user’s experience. A design concept is not only an elegant form and a fantastic function, but a realistic solution which can well address people’s needs and concerns in a specific context</span>. A hot trend of digital service is growing with the increasing use of smart devices, like tablets and smart watch. Therefore, in the M12 semester, I'll still be in the big direction of service design, but more specifically focus on the user experience of on screen interaction centered service .</p>

     <p>When kick&#45;starting the study here last semester, I set a vision of service design although with little experience of it because I am most interested in it and hope to be competent in this area in the future. Defining my personal vision on design to guide the study activities is a fresh new way for me. In some extent, it forces me to decide a specific direction in design and distinguish myself from the rest of fellow students. This vision opened a door to service design, which directed me to experience what service design is and how it works through my M11 project &quot;Service 2.0&quot;. I treated it as an exploratory start of service design and I found service design mainly relies on the core of improving user experience from perspectives of different stakeholders.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>As a designer, I put focus on creating services which are more concerned about processes and systems. In order to become a qualified service designer to provide optimized service for clients from various industries, I developed my ability of observing daily life and finding out complaints and dissatisfactions about currently organized services because it is vital at the beginning of this design journey. I started to pay attention to how to improve business performance together with enhancing customer experience across a wide range of industries and sectors.</p>

    <div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u207-11"><!-- content -->
     <p>Coming from a Chinese background, I have formed the habit to start more from feelings than rational thinking. It leads me to look at the world differently with the students from West.&nbsp; I also believe in reciprocity that the environment will response in a polite way if i behave nicely. Sometimes, these will influence my decisions and the way of execution in design. In come cases, I would act as an introvert and do not response very quickly, so people may see me as the quiet one. But actually this characteristic helps me to absorb information, analyze and filter them to get to the core of a problem definition and a concept.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>I go for aesthetics so I want all the works look beautiful, clean and prepared, especially&nbsp; when presenting to the audience. Because I think the first impression is pretty important when introducing works to others and it shows the&nbsp; professionalism as a designer. I care about details both in life and design. By observing details of&nbsp; people's behaviors and questioning details of told stories, I have got the ability to empathize the users by getting myself immersed into the context.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Speaking of the role of a designer, I want to focus on creating designs which are more concerned about the realistic needs of people. I would see myself as both a designer and a consultant of people’ life, whose mission is to provide innovative and helpful advice, in order to settle the complaints and dissatisfactions about currently organized services. The new gained experience of designing digital interactive products triggers my interest. I have experienced the pleasure and convenience digital products have in our life and I also see their potential in the market. Thus, I would continue the journey of exploration of on screen products and forward to the role more as an UX designer in the field of service design.</p>
